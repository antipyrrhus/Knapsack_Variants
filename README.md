# Knapsack_Variants

Given a text data file that contains information in the weights and values of various items, along with the weight capacity of a knapsack, this class presents three algorithmic approaches to solving the knapsack problem:

1) Recursive solution with memoization
2) Iterative solution via dynamic programming
3) Approximate solution (for the NP-complete version of the knapsack problem with non-integer weights) in accordance with the level of desired accuracy as the parameter (e.g. 90% accuracy)

To run, execute Knapsacks.java. The algorithm will run with a few of the provided data files. You may also edit the main() method to test the algorithm with other data files, provided they are in the correct format.
